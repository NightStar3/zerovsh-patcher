ZeroVSH Patcher v0.1 - NightStar3 and codestation

ZeroVSH Patcher is a plugin that allows users to customize their PSP to the 
fullest extent without writting to the flash0. ZeroVSH Patcher redirects the
loading of various file types from flash to your memory stick or internal storage, 
thus removing the fear of bricking.

Just place all the files in ms0:/PSP/VSH/ or ef0:/PSP/VSH and let the plugin do
the rest of the work.
